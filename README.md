User Details Storage API (Backend Project)
This is a simple backend project where users can submit their name, email, and image link. The server receives this data and stores it (in memory or in a database, depending on your implementation).

It's useful for learning how to handle HTTP requests, manage user data, and build basic backend logic using modern technologies like Node.js / Express / html (whichever you're using).
